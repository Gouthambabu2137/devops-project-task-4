# Task 4: Version-Controlled DevOps Project

## Overview
This task demonstrates the use of Git for version control following best practices including branching strategy, pull requests, tagging, and repository documentation.

## Branches Used
- `main` – stable production-ready code
- `dev` – integration and active development
- `feature/login` – feature-specific development

## Steps Performed
1. Initialized a new Git repository.
2. Created and pushed the following branches to GitHub: `main`, `dev`, `feature/login`.
3. Implemented `.gitignore` to exclude environment and dependency files.
4. Wrote project documentation in `README.md`.
5. Made commits and changes on the `feature/login` branch.
6. Merged `feature/login` into `main` using Git merge.
7. Created and pushed Git tag `v1.0` to mark the initial release.

## Tools Used
- **Git** – version control
- **GitHub** – remote repository hosting and collaboration

## Outcome
A clean, version-controlled repository adhering to Git best practices, ready for integration into a CI/CD pipeline or further feature development.
